\value{
ABCout_act a matrix with values simulated from the posterior distribution of the parameters of the model with activation.

Smat_act a matrix with values of summary statistics of the simulated curves for the model with activation.

ABCout_accepted_act a matrix with values simulated from the posterior distribution of the parameters
of the model with activation; it shows only the values accepted according to the automatically selected threshold.

error_act vector of computed squared differences among the observed and the simulated summary statistics for the model with activation.

tol_act automatically selected tolerance level for the model with activation; this tolerance level is used to define the matrix ABCout_accepted.

ABCout_noact a matrix with values simulated from the posterior distribution of the parameters of the model with no activation.

Smat_noact a matrix with values of summary statistics of the simulated curves for the model with no activation.

ABCout_accepted_noact a matrix with values simulated from the posterior distribution of the parameters
of the model with no activation; it shows only the values accepted according to the automatically selected threshold.

error_noact vector of computed squared differences among the observed and the simulated summary statistics for the model with no activation.

tol_noact automatically selected tolerance level for the model with no activation; this tolerance level is used to define the matrix ABCout_accepted.
